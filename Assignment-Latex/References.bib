The method compares very favourably with other known methods in speed, in economy of storage, and in ease of programming. Certain refinements of the method, which may be useful in the optimization of inner loops, are described in the second part of the paper.}",

abstract = {This paper is a practical study of how to implement the Quicksort sorting algorithm and its best variants on real computers, including how to apply various code optimization techniques. A detailed implementation combining the most effective improvements to Quicksort is given, along with a discussion of how to implement it in assembly language. Analytic results describing the performance of the programs are summarized. A variety of special situations are considered from a practical standpoint to illustrate Quicksort's wide applicability as an internal sorting method which requires negligible extra storage.},

abstract = {The design and analysis of adaptive sorting algorithms has made important contributions to both theory and practice. The main contributions from the theoretical point of view are: the description of the complexity of a sorting algorithm not only in terms of the size of a problem instance but also in terms of the disorder of the given problem instance; the establishment of new relationships among measures of disorder; the introduction of new sorting algorithms that take advantage of the existing order in the input sequence; and, the proofs that several of the new sorting algorithms achieve maximal (optimal) adaptivity with respect to several measures of disorder. The main contributions from the practical point of view are: the demonstration that several algorithms currently in use are adaptive; and, the development of new algorithms, similar to currently used algorithms that perform competitively on random sequences and are significantly faster on nearly sorted sequences. In this survey, we present the basic notions and concepts of adaptive sorting and the state of the art of adaptive sorting algorithms.},
